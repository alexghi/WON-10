    <h2><b>CINEPHILE "MUST-WATCH" LIST</b></h2>
        <p>
            Its pretty difficult to choose between favourites so in order to decide on the best artistic movie I can recommend, I used the following method:<br>
            I will rate the Visuals ,soundtrack ,script and theme aspects of the movies with a number between 1 and 5 , 
            the bigger the score the higher I will rank the movie. <br>In case of a tie , I will choose based on personal prefference.

                    In an England of the future, Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his "Droogs" 
                    spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on "a little of the old ultraviolence," while jauntily warbling "Singin' in the Rain."
                     After he's jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady to death, Alex submits to behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence. 
                     Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims.

                    Suffering from insomnia, disturbed loner Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) takes a job as a New York City cabbie, 
                    haunting the streets nightly, growing increasingly detached from reality as he dreams of cleaning up the filthy city.
                     When Travis meets pretty campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), he becomes obsessed with the idea of saving the world, first plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate,
                    then directing his attentions toward rescuing 12-year-old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).

                    Imaginatively evoking the inner landscape of human beings longing to connect, 
                    to love and feel loved, the film is a parable of happiness gloriously found and tragically lost. 
                    "Requiem for a Dream" tells parallel stories that are linked by the relationship between the lonely, widowed Sara Goldfarb and her sweet but aimless son, Harry.
                    The plump Sara, galvanized by the prospect of appearing on a
                     TV game show, has started on a dangerous diet regimen to beautify herself for a national audience.

                    The implausible escape of a brilliant murderess brings U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) 
                    and his new partner (Mark Ruffalo) to Ashecliffe Hospital, a fortress-like insane asylum located on a remote, windswept island. 
                    The woman appears to have vanished from a locked room, and there are hints of terrible deeds committed within the hospital walls.
                     As the investigation deepens, 
                    Teddy realizes he will have to confront his own dark fears if he hopes to make it off the island alive.
